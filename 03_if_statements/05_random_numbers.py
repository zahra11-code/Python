"""Print 10 random numbers in the range 1 to 100.
Here is an example run:
45 79 61 47 52 10 16 83 19 12
Each time you run your program you should get different numbers
81 76 70 1 27 63 96 100 32 92
Recall that the python random library has a function randint which returns an integer
in the range set by the parameters (inclusive). 
For example this call would produce a random integer between 1 and 6, 
which could include 1 and could include 6:
value = random.randint(1, 6)
